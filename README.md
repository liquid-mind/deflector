Deflector
=========

Java checked exception to runtime exception converter.

If you have stumbled across this page please note that while the API is being used on a number of projects at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (http://www.zhaw.ch) it is not quite ready for general use at this time. We are still working on the code and documentation and will update this REAME when it is ready to try out. For the truely adventurous, installation and usage support may be had by contacting john.brush@zhaw.ch.
